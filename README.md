Sarcasm is a linguistic phenomenon in which the speaker or author states the opposite or a variation of the desired meaning. The detection of sarcasm is a difficult task, as it's rather dependent on subjective understadings. But it's also a critical NLP application, especially in correctly handling texts expressing opinions. One of the most typical scenario is titles of news articles, where sarcasm is popularly used and limited context poses great challenge for accurate detection. 

For the data source, a Kaggle dataset consisting of news headlines and their corresponding labels is chosen.  It has a total number of 28,619 records, with 13,634 sarcastic and 14,985 not sarcastic.
